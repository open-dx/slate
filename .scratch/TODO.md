Re-write Surface Provider Logic:
    - Break out Surface providers: Window, Node, Scene.
    - Providers should hold a StyleGuide, FontRegistry, and EventRegistry.
    - On each draw pass, send updates to either spawn_element or update_element.
    - The `surface_provider.apply_styles(..)` method should take the ElementNode and an EntityCommands instance.
        - Can we immediately apply commands after they're built, or do we need to let the scheduling system handle it?

Re-write the Window System:
    - On spawning a new window, check for an attached WindowSurface.
        - Spawn a 3D camera for the Window.
        - When it exists, spawn 2D camera for bottom layer.
        - Spawn a "hud" for the window and hide it.

Re-write the Event System:
    - Events should be indexed by event kind.
    - Can we allow runtimes to handle arbitrary event types?
    - Should we use `[entity].observe()`?

Re-write the Style System:
    - Implement psuedo-states (hover, focus, etc.)
        - Use Bevy's Interaction System to apply style properties for states.
    - Chalk should auto-generate everything except the style enum and types.
    - Styles are a known-quantity. We can pre-allocate the list better.
        - Can we use an array sized to StyleRef variants' count?
    - Implement the Content attribute.

Re-write the Webview System:
    - Can we fork Wry and make it use Winit directly?
    - Move the winit-specific/non-bevy parts it to its own repo.
        - Write a README + CONTRIBUTING + Docs.
        - Write a few useful examples.
    - Add an interface for 

Add support for images and videos.
    - Use

    - Update SurfaceProvider (bevy) to use web renderer when in wasm context.
